Also called the domestic dog, it was selectively bred from an extinct population of wolves during the Late Pleistocene by hunter-gatherers. The dog was the first species to be domesticated by humans, over 14,000 years ago and before the development of agriculture. Due to their long association with humans, dogs have gained the ability to thrive on a starch-rich diet that would be inadequate for other canids.\n\nArxiv: <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<feed xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom\">\n  <link href=\"http://arxiv.org/api/query?search_query%3Dall%3Adogs%26id_list%3D%26start%3D0%26max_results%3D1\" rel=\"self\" type=\"application/atom+xml\"/>\n  <title type=\"html\">ArXiv Query: search_query=all:dogs&amp;id_list=&amp;start=0&amp;max_results=1</title>\n  <id>http://arxiv.org/api/GtQtKCMpo5mgie54fOUkogHi4fw</id>\n  <updated>2025-03-02T00:00:00-05:00</updated>\n  <opensearch:totalResults xmlns:opensearch=\"http://a9.com/-/spec/opensearch/1.1/\">828</opensearch:totalResults>\n  <opensearch:startIndex xmlns:opensearch=\"http://a9.com/-/spec/opensearch/1.1/\">0</opensearch:startIndex>\n  <opensearch:itemsPerPage xmlns:opensearch=\"http://a9.com/-/spec/opensearch/1.1/\">1</opensearch:itemsPerPage>\n  <entry>\n    <id>http://arxiv.org/abs/2402.06790v1</id>\n    <updated>2024-02-09T21:24:13Z</updated>\n    <published>2024-02-09T21:24:13Z</published>\n    <title>Towards Robotic Companions: Understanding Handler-Guide Dog I",
    "article": "**Title:** The Evolution of the Domestic Dog: From Wolf to Man's Best Friend\n\n**Introduction:**\n In a groundbreaking study published on arXiv, researchers delve into the origins and evolution of our beloved domestic dog (Canis lupus familiaris), tracing its lineage back to the gray wolf (Canis lupus). The findings shed new light on how selective breeding has shaped these animals into a vast array of breeds with diverse behaviors, sensory capabilities, and physical attributes.\n\n**Key Insights:**\n- **DNA evidence suggests that dogs have been selectively bred for desired behaviors, sensory capabilities, and physical attributes over thousands of years, with the earliest domestication occurring around 14,000 years ago during the Late Pleistocene by hunter-gatherer communities.\n\n- The dog was selectively bred from an extinct population of wolves, leading to the development of distinct breeds with varying appearances, temperaments, and skillsets.\n\n- Today, there are over 340 distinct breeds, each with its unique set of traits, making dogs one of the most diverse species in terms of form and function.\n\n- Despite their diversity, all dogs share a common ancestry, making them all direct descendants of the gray wolf.\n\n- The domestication process has not only changed dogs' physical appearances but also their behavior. They have gained the ability to thrive on a starch-rich diet, unlike their wolf ancestors, due to their long association with humans and the development of agriculture.\n\n**Industry Impact:**\n- The study highlights the importance of understanding dogs' evolutionary journey to better comprehend their needs and care requirements.\n\n- It underscores the significance of adopting dogs from shelters instead of buying from breeders, as many mixed-breed dogs can make excellent companions and are in need of loving homes.\n\n- The findings also emphasize the importance of responsible breeding practices to maintain the health and well-being of dogs.\n\n**Future Prospects:**\n- Future research should focus on understanding the genetic basis of the diverse traits seen in dogs to aid in conservation efforts and inform breeding practices.\n\n- Further investigation into the domestication process can provide insights into human-animal interactions and the coevolution of species.\n\n**Conclusion:**\nThe evolution of the domestic dog is a testament to the power of selective breeding and the profound impact humans can have on shaping species. Understanding this journey is not only fascinating but also crucial for ensuring the well-being of our canine companions. As we continue to unravel the mysteries of our shared history, we can better appreciate the bond between humans and dogs, which has endured for thousands of years"
