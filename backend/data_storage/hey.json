    "article": "Make sure to include the correct title of the app as \"Hey\" (without the exclamation), even though the user wrote \"HEY\". Use proper capitalization for the title. Also, ensure that the Backstreet Boys' song \"Hey\" is mentioned as an example of cultural references but clarify that it's unrelated to the app. The Arxiv entry seems unrelated, so omit it from the article. Avoid using markdown in the final answer.\n\nAlright, let's tackle this query step by step. The user wants a news article based on the provided research snippets. The key points here are to follow the specified structure and ensure accuracy, especially regarding the app's name and excluding the Arxiv entry.\n\nFirst, the title needs to be \"Hey\" without the exclamation, so I'll check that. The introduction should highlight the excitement around the app, referencing the Google review. I need to mention that it's a rethinking of email with bold ideas. Also, clarify that \"Hey\" as an app is separate from the Backstreet Boys' song and the general term.\n\nNext, the key insights section should pull from the Google description: rethinking email, bold ideas, user experience focus. Maybe mention specific features like no ads, prioritized emails, or unique interface elements. The industry impact part should discuss how this challenges traditional email services like Gmail or Outlook, maybe talk about user engagement or market competition.\n\nFuture prospects could explore potential updates, expansion into other productivity areas, or partnerships. The conclusion should wrap up the significance of Hey's innovation and its potential long-term effects on digital communication.\n\nI must remember to mention the Backstreet Boys' song as a cultural reference but state it's unrelated. The Arxiv entry is unrelated, so I'll omit it entirely. Also, ensure proper capitalization for the app's title. Need to check that all facts from the Google snippet are included, like \"highly recommended\" and the excitement expressed. Avoid any markdown, keep paragraphs clear and concise.\n\nWait, the user mentioned \"HEY is the most exciting app...\" but the correct title is \"Hey\". So in the article, I'll use \"Hey\" properly. Also, the Wikipedia entry lists possible meanings, so I should note that \"Hey\" can refer to other things but focus on the app. The Backstreet Boys' song is listed there too, so include that as an example but clarify the separation.\n\nPutting it all together, structure each section as per the outline, ensure flow between paragraphs, and maintain a professional yet engaging tone.
