Advances in archaeology and genetics have shown that the domestication of the cat occurred in the Near East around 7500 BC. It is commonly kept as a pet and farm cat, but also ranges freely as a feral cat avoiding human contact. It is valued by humans for companionship and its ability to kill vermin. Its retractable claws are adapted to killing small prey species such as mice and rats. It has a strong, flexible body, quick reflexes, and sharp teeth, and its night vision and sense of smell are well developed. It is a social species, but a solitary hunter and a crepuscular predator. Cat communication includes vocalizations\u2014including meowing, purring, trilling, hissing, growling, and grunting\u2014as well as body language. It can hear sounds too faint or too high in frequency for human ears, such as those made by small mammals. It secretes and perceives pheromones.\n\nArxiv: <?xml version=\"1.0\" encoding=\"UTF-8\"?>\n<feed xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2005/Atom\">\n  <link href=\"http://arxiv.org/api/query?search_query%3Dall%3Acats%26id_list%3D%26start%3D0%26max_results%3D1\" rel=\"self\" type=\"application/atom+xml\"/>\n  <title type=\"html\">ArXiv Query: search_query=all:cats&amp;id_list=&amp;start=0&amp;max_results=1</title>\n  <id>http://arxiv.org/api/j28FZMeoHWrqzouhfCmfBaJBojo</id>\n  <updated>2025-03-02T00:00:00-05:00</updated>\n  <opensearch:totalResults xmlns:opensearch=\"http://a9.com/-/spec/opensearch/1.1/\">3946</opensearch:totalResults>\n  <opensearch:startIndex xmlns:opensearch=\"http://a9.com/-/spec/opensearch/1.1/\">0</opensearch:startIndex>\n  <opensearch:itemsPerPage xmlns:opensearch=\"http://a9.com/-/spec/opensearch/1.1/\">1</opensearch:itemsPerPage>\n  <entry>\n    <id>http://arxiv.org/abs/1703.07003v1</id>\n    <updated>2017-03-20T23:28:25Z</updated>\n    <published>2017-03-20T23:28:25Z</published>\n    <title>Semistability and CAT(0) Geometry</title>\n    <summary>  We ",
